			<h3>Lonely Cube</h3>
			<p>Here is my latest project, a game called Lonely Cube, it is FAR from done (only 3 levels, more in the future) and it is very unpolished.</p>
			<p>Made in Unity, you play as a cube who is trying to find its way out of levels that progress with difficulty. Along the way you find bad guys who probably aren't so friendly and want you to fail, but that won't stop you.</p>
