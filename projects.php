			<h3>Rubik's Cube Timer and Scrambler</h3>
			<p>This is a program I made with a partner for a project in grade 12 Computer Science class.</p>
			<p>Targeted towards Rubik's Cube hobbyists, it allows them to scramble their Rubik's cube with a randomly generated scramble and then time their solve.
			Their times are then stored so they can be accessed and so the averages can be calculated</p>
			<p>To download <a href="rubix.jar">click here</a></p>
			<p>Note: in the directory that the jar file is placed, it will create a src folder which stores the times</p>
