	<h1><strong>About</strong></h1>

	<p>This website is basically a test site that I used to learn more CSS, HTML, SQL, and PHP.</p>

	<p>I learned most of my early coding skills from Codecademy. That site allowed me to learn programming quickly, but I found I still had a lot to learn even after using
	it. From there I decided to learn about PHP and used that to create a basic login system that my site currently has implemented. I had prior experience with Java before
	learning about HTML and CSS but later learned about it through school and my own small applications. In school as well as in online course I learned Python and used that
	to make some small scripts.</p>
