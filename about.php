	<h1><strong>About</strong></h1>

	<p>This website is basically a test site (Or maybe even full site) that I will be using to update about myself, and learn more CSS and HTML.</p>

	<p>I learned most of my coding skills from Codecademy. Though
	I did learn better website making skills from Codeschool. Before I learned HTML and CSS, I used to program in Java and C#,
	it was fun to program in those languages but I just felt I really didn't like these languages. Then I decided to learn
	HTML, and boy was it a good idea because I learned a LOT from it and I became more used to creating websites.</p>

	<p>At first, when learning with Codecademy, I wasn't really good at making websites. I didn't know how to properly design websites, make them look good, 
	what kind of features I should add but after I started learning with Codeschool it became easier. But I still thank Codecademy for starting me off.</p>
