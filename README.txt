This is a basic site I created from scratch using HTML, CSS, PHP and a little bit of Javascript.

I taught myself all the languages above to create this site.

I created it originally just to see what I could do using HTML and CSS and after a while I learned a lot more.

Creating the login system was a challenge I set up for my self and required me to learn all about PHP and how it communicates with servers. 
This led me to learn about MySQL and XAMPP. 

After creating a very basic login system with PHP in conjunction with MySQL, I could store usernames and passwords in PLAINTEXT to a 
database. Realising the obvious problem with, it led me to research about different cybersecurity methods used in the industry to store 
passwords. For example, I had to learn about cryptography to ensure that passwords are stored in a secure way in the database. Another 
example is that I learned about how SQL Injections are possible through submitting forms, so I had to make sure that any string entered by 
the user was escaped beforehand.

Because I used my intuition and some basc research, I still have a lot of incomplete knowledge which makes me more excited to 
learn about how the back-end of a website functions. However, it also means this project is not very well documented at all, and is laid 
out messily. Doing it again, I realise I could put much more effort into the structure of the site and the documentation.

Overall, I learned a lot through this project and while still unfinished and unpolished, I am proud of what I created as I never realised
that I could do this.
