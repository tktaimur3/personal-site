This is a basic site I created from scratch using HTML, CSS, PHP and a little bit of Javascript

I taught myself all the languages above to create this site

I created it originally just to see what I could do using HTML and CSS and after a while I learned a lot more

Creating the login system was a challenge I set up for my self and required me to learn all about PHP and how it communicates with servers. 
This led me to learn about MySQL and XAMPP. 

After creating a very basic login system with PHP in conjunction with MySQL, I could store usernames and passwords in PLAINTEXT to a 
database. Realising the obvious problem with, it led me to research about different cybersecurity methods used in the industry.
For example, I had to learn about hashes that make sure passwords aren't stored in plaintext in the database. Another example is that 
I had to prevent SQL injections which was fairly easy to do but still interesting.

Because I had to use intuition and some basic research, I still have a lot of incomplete knowledge which makes me more excited to 
learn about how the back-end of a website functions

Overall, I learned a lot through this project and while still unfinished and unpolished, I am proud of what I created as I never realised
that I could do this.
